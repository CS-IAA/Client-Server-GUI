# Tkinter-Client-Server
Create a GUI that checks ENCRYPTED username/password versus an ENCRYPTED database of usernames/passwords. It also verifies that time is within 10 minutes of the server. If the time is off, or password/username is wrong, tell them they can't log in. If it is correct, just have a window pop up that says logged in. I need an example username/password I can check. Same as before, client and server should be local.
Username,passwords

bob, password
